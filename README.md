# Mycode: Archiving by Projects

## Executable
- __BatchCorrection__

    Since it is an on going project, I only uploaded my evaluation on a test dataset. 

    In this preview version,I tested 5 methods: BBKNN, ComBat, Harmony,iMAP,RISC. I use kBET and LISI as the evaluation index.  As for the running memory and time, I recorded from the LSF system.

 
## Fragments
    The code attached is the remaining fragment and is not strictly generated.
  
- __2021MCM__
    
    In this project, I built a model for fungus' dominance-tolerance trade off and stimulated the fungus growth under difference climates. 
    


- __correlation research__

     Using a pre-proposed method to find potencial enhancer from data avaliable on TCGA. The key idea is to scan the pearson correlation coefficence of a gene and the fragments nearby.


- __BLAST reimplement__
    
    My midterm project of computational biology course. I used histogram to simplify the aligning process.


Thanks for reading!
